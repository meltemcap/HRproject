# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction – Salifort Motors
# Project Overview
Employee retention is a key priority for HR departments, as high turnover can lead to increased recruitment costs, loss of knowledge, and decreased team morale. At Salifort Motors, the HR department has collected various employee-related data in an effort to better understand the factors that may contribute to employee attrition (voluntary resignation).

This project aims to analyze this dataset and build a predictive model that can identify which employees are most likely to leave the company. By doing so, we can help the HR team take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates.

# Goals
Analyze historical employee data to uncover trends and key indicators of attrition.

Identify the most influential features contributing to employee decisions to leave.

Develop a classification model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

Provide data-driven insights and recommendations to the HR department for improving retention.

# Why This Matters
Replacing an employee involves significant time, money, and effort. With a reliable prediction system in place, Salifort Motors can:

Target at-risk employees with personalized interventions.

Improve organizational culture and working conditions.

Make strategic HR decisions backed by data.

Preventing even a small percentage of resignations can lead to substantial cost savings and higher workforce stability.

# Dataset
The dataset that you'll be using in this lab contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below.

# Methodology

# 1- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: 
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.

# 2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing patterns and relationships between features and attrition.

# 3- Feature Engineering:
Identifying and selecting key features that impact attrition.

# 4- Model Building:
Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict attrition.

# 5- Model Evaluation:
Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.

# 6- Interpretation & Insights:
Using feature importance and SHAP values to explain the model’s decisions.

# Expected Outcomes
-A trained machine learning model that predicts employee attrition.
-A dashboard or visual report highlighting critical attrition factors.
-Strategic recommendations for the HR team.

# Technologies Used
-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)

# Conclusion
By combining data analysis and machine learning, this project provides actionable insights to help Salifort Motors retain valuable talent and foster a better work environment. The HR team can use these findings to prioritize employee well-being and make data-driven policy changes.
